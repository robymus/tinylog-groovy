# tinylog-groovy

This plugin adds support for class/method name resolution and readable exception logging for groovy to tinylog.

This is under development - the patches for plugin support in tinylog are not complete yet, so it won't be incorporated in the main distribution anytime soon.

It looks like this is a dead end, I've dropped development of this project as it didn't work out as expected.
